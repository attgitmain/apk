# API Vulnerability Reconnaissance

This document summarizes a brief reconnaissance of `https://api.flightclass.com.br`.

## Observations

- The root endpoint responds with `302 Found` and redirects to `https://app.flightclass.com.br`.
- Response headers indicate the backend server is **Envoy** and sets several cookies including `XSRF-TOKEN` and `flight_class_session`.
- An `OPTIONS` request only allows the methods `GET` and `HEAD`.
- A `robots.txt` file exists with no disallowed paths.
- Attempting to retrieve `.well-known/security.txt` returns a *404 Not Found* page.
- Network scanning with `nmap` was attempted but failed due to routing restrictions:
  - See `nmap_scan.txt` for the error output.
- Direct TLS inspection with `openssl s_client` also failed for the same reason, resulting in an empty `tls_info.txt`.

## Files

- `api_headers.txt` – raw headers from `curl -I https://api.flightclass.com.br/`.
- `api_options.txt` – headers from `OPTIONS` request.
- `api_html_snippet.txt` – snippet of the HTML body showing the redirect.
- `api_robots.txt` – content of the `robots.txt` file.
- `api_security.txt` – 404 page from `/.well-known/security.txt`.
- `api_health.txt` – response body from `/health` endpoint (404).
- `api_path_response.txt` – response for `/api/v3/app/Algorithm` (404).
- `nmap_scan.txt` – nmap output showing routing failure.
- `tls_info.txt` – empty file; TLS handshake attempt failed.

## Recommendations

- Confirm that the redirect from the API root is intentional. Providing an API landing page with documentation or status information may help consumers.
- Ensure secure cookie attributes (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`) are set as required; these appear to be configured.
- Publish a security policy via `.well-known/security.txt` so researchers know how to report vulnerabilities.
- Review Envoy and upstream application configurations for any exposed debug endpoints or default routes not meant for production.
- Since network scanning could not be performed, consider running a full port scan from an environment with direct network access.
